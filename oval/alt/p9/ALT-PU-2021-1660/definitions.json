        "Description": "This update upgrades glpi to version 9.5.4-alt1. \nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n * CVE-2021-21255: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI version 9.5.3, it was possible to switch entities with IDOR from a logged in user. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.\n\n * CVE-2021-21258: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI from version 9.5.0 and before version 9.5.4, there is a cross-site scripting injection vulnerability when using ajax/kanban.php. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.\n\n * CVE-2021-21312: GLPI is open source software which stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. In GLPI before verison 9.5.4, there is a vulnerability within the document upload function (Home \u003e Management \u003e Documents \u003e Add, or /front/document.form.php endpoint), indeed one of the form field: \"Web Link\" is not properly sanitized and a malicious user (who has document upload rights) can use it to deliver JavaScript payload. For example if you use the following payload: \" accesskey=\"x\" onclick=\"alert(1)\" x=\", the content will be saved within the database without any control. And then once you return to the summary documents page, by clicking on the \"Web Link\" of the newly created file it will create a new empty tab, but on the initial tab the pop-up \"1\" will appear.\n\n * CVE-2021-21313: GLPI is open source software which stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. In GLPI before verison 9.5.4, there is a vulnerability in the /ajax/common.tabs.php endpoint, indeed, at least two parameters _target and id are not properly sanitized. Here are two payloads (due to two different exploitations depending on which parameter you act) to exploit the vulnerability:/ajax/common.tabs.php?_target=javascript:alert(document.cookie)\u0026_itemtype=DisplayPreference\u0026_glpi_tab=DisplayPreference$2\u0026id=258\u0026displaytype=Ticket (Payload triggered if you click on the button). /ajax/common.tabs.php?_target=/front/ticket.form.php\u0026_itemtype=Ticket\u0026_glpi_tab=Ticket$1\u0026id=(){};(function%20(){alert(document.cookie);})();function%20a\u0026#.\n\n * CVE-2021-21314: GLPI is open source software which stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. In GLPI before verison 9.5.4, there is an XSS vulnerability involving a logged in user while updating a ticket.\n\n * CVE-2021-21324: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI before version 9.5.4 there is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) on \"Solutions\". This vulnerability gives an unauthorized user the ability to enumerate GLPI items names (including users logins) using the knowbase search form (requires authentication). To Reproduce: Perform a valid authentication at your GLPI instance, Browse the ticket list and select any open ticket, click on Solution form, then Search a solution form that will redirect you to the endpoint /\"glpi/front/knowbaseitem.php?item_itemtype=Ticket\u0026item_items_id=18\u0026forcetab=Knowbase$1\", and the item_itemtype=Ticket parameter present in the previous URL will point to the PHP alias of glpi_tickets table, so just replace it with \"Users\" to point to glpi_users table instead; in the same way, item_items_id=18 will point to the related column id, so changing it too you should be able to enumerate all the content which has an alias. Since such id(s) are obviously incremental, a malicious party could exploit the vulnerability simply by guessing-based attempts.\n\n * CVE-2021-21325: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI before version 9.5.4 a new budget type can be defined by user. This input is not correctly filtered. This results in a cross-site scripting attack. To exploit this endpoint attacker need to be authenticated. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.\n\n * CVE-2021-21326: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI before version 9.5.4 it is possible to create tickets for another user with self-service interface without delegatee systems enabled. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.\n\n * CVE-2021-21327: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI before version 9.5.4 non-authenticated user can remotely instantiate object of any class existing in the GLPI environment that can be used to carry out malicious attacks, or to start a “POP chain”. As an example of direct impact, this vulnerability affects integrity of the GLPI core platform and third-party plugins runtime misusing classes which implement some sensitive operations in their constructors or destructors. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.",
