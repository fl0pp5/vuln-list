        "Description": "This update upgrades moodle to version 3.7.2-alt2. \nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n * CVE-2019-14827: A vulnerability was found in Moodle where javaScript injection was possible in some Mustache templates via recursive rendering from contexts. Mustache helper tags that were included in template contexts were not being escaped before that context was injected into another Mustache helper, which could result in script injection in some templates. This affects versions 3.7 to 3.7.1, 3.6 to 3.6.5, 3.5 to 3.5.7 and earlier unsupported versions.\n\n * CVE-2019-14828: A vulnerability was found in Moodle affecting 3.7 to 3.7.1, 3.6 to 3.6.5, 3.5 to 3.5.7 and earlier unsupported versions, where users with the capability to create courses were assigned as a teacher in those courses, regardless of whether they had the capability to be automatically assigned that role.\n\n * CVE-2019-14829: A vulnerability was found in Moodle affection 3.7 to 3.7.1, 3.6 to 3.6.5, 3.5 to 3.5.7 and earlier unsupported versions where activity creation capabilities were not correctly respected when selecting the activity to use for a course in single activity mode.\n\n * CVE-2019-14830: A vulnerability was found in Moodle 3.7 to 3.7.1, 3.6 to 3.6.5, 3.5 to 3.5.7 and earlier unsupported versions, where the mobile launch endpoint contained an open redirect in some circumstances, which could result in a user's mobile access token being exposed. (Note: This does not affect sites with a forced URL scheme configured, mobile service disabled, or where the mobile app login method is \"via the app\").\n\n * CVE-2019-14831: A vulnerability was found in Moodle 3.7 to 3.7.1, 3.6 to 3.6.5, 3.5 to 3.5.7 and earlier unsupported versions, where forum subscribe link contained an open redirect if forced subscription mode was enabled. If a forum's subscription mode was set to \"forced subscription\", the forum's subscribe link contained an open redirect.\n\n * CVE-2019-14881: A vulnerability was found in moodle 3.7 before 3.7.3, where there is blind XSS reflected in some locations where user email is displayed.\n\n * CVE-2020-1692: Moodle before version 3.7.2 is vulnerable to information exposure of service tokens for users enrolled in the same course.",
