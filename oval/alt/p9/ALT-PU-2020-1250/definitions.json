        "Description": "This update upgrades moodle to version 3.8.1-alt1. \nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n * CVE-2019-14879: A vulnerability was found in Moodle versions 3.7.x before 3.7.3, 3.6.x before 3.6.7 and 3.5.x before 3.5.9. When a cohort role assignment was removed, the associated capabilities were not being revoked (where applicable).\n\n * CVE-2019-14880: A vulnerability was found in Moodle versions 3.7 before 3.7.3, 3.6 before 3.6.7, 3.5 before 3.5.9 and earlier. OAuth 2 providers who do not verify users' email address changes require additional verification during sign-up to reduce the risk of account compromise.\n\n * CVE-2019-14882: A vulnerability was found in Moodle 3.7 to 3.7.3, 3.6 to 3.6.7, 3.5 to 3.5.9 and earlier where an open redirect existed in the Lesson edit page.\n\n * CVE-2019-14883: A vulnerability was found in Moodle 3.6 before 3.6.7 and 3.7 before 3.7.3, where tokens used to fetch inline atachments in email notifications were not disabled when a user's account was no longer active. Note: to access files, a user would need to know the file path, and their token.\n\n * CVE-2019-14884: A vulnerability was found in Moodle 3.7 before 3.73, 3.6 before 3.6.7 and 3.5 before 3.5.9, where a reflected XSS possible from some fatal error messages.\n\n * CVE-2019-18210: Persistent XSS in /course/modedit.php of Moodle through 3.7.2 allows authenticated users (Teacher and above) to inject JavaScript into the session of another user (e.g., enrolled student or site administrator) via the introeditor[text] parameter. NOTE: the discoverer and vendor disagree on whether Moodle customers have a reasonable expectation that anyone authenticated as a Teacher can be trusted with the ability to add arbitrary JavaScript (this ability is not documented on Moodle's Teacher_role page). Because the vendor has this expectation, they have stated \"this report has been closed as a false positive, and not a bug.\"",
